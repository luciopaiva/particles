# To do

- fix the nearest n when considering neighbors?
- show cell grid
- paint particles according to their heading
- paint particles according to their current cell (would detected particles out of their respective cells)
- walls should just bounce instead of repelling (particles that start too close to the walls end up being slingshotted at high speed)
- press spacebar to introduce particles, all travelling at the same speed and heading
- add energy loss (heat?) when particles travel (and maybe when then collide)
