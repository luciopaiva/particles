# To do

- neighbor influence should be decided by culling distance, not a fixed number of neighbors regardless of how distant they are
- hide trail by erasing the last position prior to painting the new one (or is it a feature?)
- add borders that repel particles (keeping them from fleeing the scene)
- smarter spatial index
